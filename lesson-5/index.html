         <p class="text">The 3rd largest island in the world, Borneo is stunning for its verdant jungles, dramatic
            coastlines and
            incredible biodiversity. Land and sea teem with exotic endemic species, many of which are endangered. Spend
            11 exhilarating days exploring Malaysian Borneo, on the island’s northeastern edge. Set out on day and night
            hikes, river safaris and 4x4 excursions, looking for local wildlife, including orangutans, leopard cats,
            hornbills and more. Stay in jungle lodges nestled within wildlife reserves close to the action.</p>
